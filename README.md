# Shehab-Note Recurring Task Manager

A powerful recurring task management plugin for Shehab-Note (SiYuan fork) with advanced scheduling, multi-channel notifications, visual timeline planning, and **inline task creation**.

## Features

### ✨ Inline Task Creation (NEW)

Create tasks directly in your notes using natural markdown syntax with emoji-based metadata:

```markdown
- [ ] Buy groceries 📅 tomorrow #personal
- [ ] Weekly report 📅 next friday 🔁 every week 🔼 #work
- [ ] Deploy app 🆔 deploy-v2 ⛔ tests-pass 🔺 #release
```

**🎯 Auto-Creation (Phase 3):**
- ⚡ **Automatic task creation** - Press Enter or blur to auto-create tasks
- 🛡️ **Duplicate prevention** - Won't create multiple tasks for the same checklist
- 💡 **Visual error hints** - See parse errors inline without corrupting text
- ⚙️ **Flexible settings** - Control when and how tasks are created

[📖 Auto-Creation Guide](./docs/AUTO_CREATION.md) | [📖 Inline Syntax Reference](./docs/InlineTaskSyntax.md)

**Supported metadata:**
- 📅 **Due dates:** ISO dates or natural language (today, tomorrow, next week, etc.)
- ⏳ **Scheduled dates:** When to start working
- 🛫 **Start dates:** Earliest start date
- 🔁 **Recurrence:** `every day/week/month/year`, `when done`, custom patterns
- 🔺🔼🔽 **Priority:** High, Medium, Low
- 🆔 **Task IDs:** Unique identifiers
- ⛔ **Dependencies:** Link tasks together
- #️⃣ **Tags:** Categorize and filter

### 🔁 Advanced Recurrence Rules
- **Daily, Weekly, Monthly scheduling** with customizable intervals
- **Fixed-time scheduling** (e.g., every day at 09:00)
- **Weekday-specific rules** for weekly tasks
- **Intelligent rescheduling** after task completion

### 📋 Task Management
- **Today & Overdue View** - Quick access to tasks requiring attention
- **All Tasks View** - Comprehensive task management with enable/disable toggles
- **Timeline View** - Visual calendar showing upcoming tasks for the next 30 days

### 📅 Natural Language Date Parsing (NEW)
Create tasks faster by typing dates naturally:

- **Relative dates**: `tomorrow`, `in 3 days`, `next week`, `next month`
- **Named days**: `Monday`, `next Friday`, `last Tuesday`  
- **Specific dates**: `Jan 15`, `2024-01-15`, `March 3rd`
- **Times**: `at 9am`, `2:30pm`, `14:00`
- **Combined**: `tomorrow at 3pm`, `next Friday at 9am`
- **Shortcuts**: `eod` (end of day), `eow` (end of week), `eom` (end of month)

**Features:**
- 🎯 **Smart autocomplete** - Intelligent suggestions as you type
- ⌨️ **Keyboard shortcuts** - Quick date entry (Ctrl/Cmd+T for today, Ctrl/Cmd+M for tomorrow)
- ✓ **Real-time validation** - Visual feedback shows parsed dates instantly
- 🔄 **Fallback date picker** - Traditional date/time picker always available

See [Natural Language Dates Documentation](docs/NATURAL_LANGUAGE_DATES.md) for complete reference.

### 🏗️ Dashboard Architecture (NEW)

The plugin features a modern, well-architected dashboard system with clear separation of concerns:

- **Adapter Layer** - Type-safe data transformation between UI and business logic
- **Validation Layer** - Robust input validation before persistence
- **Persistent Dashboard** - Always-available sidebar interface for quick task creation
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 59 unit and integration tests for adapters, validators, and dashboard

**Documentation:**
- [Architecture Diagram](docs/integration/architecture-diagram.md) - System architecture overview
- [Data Flow](docs/integration/data-flow.md) - How data moves through the system
- [Field Mapping](docs/integration/field-mapping.md) - Complete field reference
- [Migration Guide](docs/integration/migration-guide.md) - Upgrade guide for users

### 🔔 Multi-Channel Notifications
- **n8n** - Webhook integration for workflow automation
- **Telegram** - Direct messaging via Telegram Bot API
- **Gmail** - Email notifications via Gmail API
- Send custom payloads including notes, media URLs, and links

### 🎯 Task Actions
- **✅ Done** - Mark task complete and automatically schedule next occurrence
- **🕒 Delay** - Postpone task to tomorrow without affecting recurrence pattern
- **✏️ Edit** - Modify task details, frequency, and notification settings
- **🗑️ Delete** - Remove tasks permanently

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Drmusab/plugin-sample-shehab-note/releases)
2. Extract the `package.zip` to your Shehab-Note plugins directory
3. Restart Shehab-Note or reload plugins
4. Open the "Recurring Tasks" dock panel from the right sidebar

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Shehab-Note or SiYuan installation

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the plugin
npm run build

# Development mode with auto-rebuild
npm run dev

# Create symbolic link to your workspace (optional)
npm run make-link -- --workspace=/path/to/shehab-note/workspace
```

### Project Structure

The plugin follows a **clean 3-layer architecture** with strict separation of concerns:

```
src/
 backend/                  # Business logic and data management
    api/, blocks/, commands/, core/, events/, features/
    integrations/, logging/, services/, webhooks/
 frontend/                 # UI components and presentation
    components/, hooks/, modals/, stores/, styles/, views/
 shared/                   # Shared utilities and types
     assets/, config/, constants/, utils/
```

**Architecture Highlights:**
-  **3-Layer Separation**: Backend (business logic)  Shared (utilities/types)  Frontend (UI)
-  **Path Aliases**: Clean imports (`@backend`, `@frontend`, `@shared`)
-  **No Business Logic in Frontend**: All domain logic in backend layer
-  **Event-Driven**: Scheduler emits events, services react
-  **Singleton Managers**: TaskManager, Scheduler use getInstance() pattern
-  **Storage Abstraction**: Repository pattern decouples from SiYuan API

- [Backend README](src/backend/README.md) - Business logic architecture
- [Frontend README](src/frontend/README.md) - UI component structure
- [Shared README](src/shared/README.md) - Shared utilities guide

   - Block automatically linked for quick access
4. Complete the task details and click "Save Task"

**Quick Actions for Linked Blocks:**

### Missed Task Recovery (NEW)

The plugin now automatically recovers missed tasks after being offline:

- When the plugin restarts, it checks for tasks that were due while offline
- All missed occurrences are detected and notifications are sent
- Overdue tasks are automatically advanced to their next future occurrence
- No manual intervention needed - recovery happens automatically

**Example:** If your plugin was offline for 3 days and a daily task was due at 9 AM each day:
- You'll receive notifications for all 3 missed days
- The task will be rescheduled to tomorrow at 9 AM
